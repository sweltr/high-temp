The circular heating structure was 3.5 m in diameter and extended to 1.2 m depth, which resulted in an effective heated plot of approximately 5 m diameter x > 1.5 m depth (i.e. to the bedrock, situated at around 1.5--2.0 m across the study site). The experiment consisted of five warmed and control plot-pairs in total.")

Shapiro-Wilk Normality and Bartlett tests indicated all alpha diversity estimates (following PERfect filtering) wer normally distributed and differences were assessed for (\\textbf{a}) bacteria and (\\textbf{d}) fungi using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey HSD post hoc tests. Compositional similarity of microbial communities (beta-diversity) represented as PCoA ordination plots of PERfect filtered data for (\\textbf{b}) bacteria—estimated using Unweighted (left) and Weighted Unifrac (right) distance matrices; and (\\textbf{e}) fungi estimated—using Jensen–Shannon divergence (left) and Bray-Curtis (right) distance matrices.

## Table captions
caption_tab("tab_ext_1", "\\textbf{Relationship of bacterial and fungal richness with (a) environmental drivers, (b) microbial functional responses and (c) microbial temperature adaptive responses}. For environmental drivers of richness (\\textbf{a}), we included temperature, moisture and key edaphic properties: models included fixed effects of Environmental drivers: treatment level (warming by +3°C and +8°C), soil moisture, soil properties (pH, N, resin P and ECEC), treatment:moisture interaction. For microbial functional correlates of richness (\\textbf{b}), we included CO$_{2}$ efflux, microbial C and activity of four enzymes (V$_{\\mathrm{max}}$ for phosphomonoesterase, $\\beta$-glucosidase, $\\beta$-xylanase and \\textsl{N}-acetyl $\\beta$-glucosaminidase). For microbial temperature adaptation correlates of richness (\\textbf{c}), we included CUE (determined by C:N and C:P ratios of enzymatic activity), the temperature sensitivity (\\textsl{Q}$_{10}$) of four enzymes (\\textsl{Q}$_{10}$ of V$_{\\mathrm{max}}$ for phosphomonoesterase, $\\beta$-glucosidase, $\\beta$-xylanase and \\textsl{N}-acetyl $\\beta$-glucosaminidase), the minimum temperature for microbial growth (T$_{\\mathrm{min}}$) and the sensitivity index for microbial growth (SI = log 40/4 growth). For all models we included a random effect of plot pair (i.e. space).")

caption_tab("tab_ext_2", "\\textbf{The relationship between (a) bacterial and (b) fungal beta-diversity and edaphic environment (i), soil process rates (ii) and microbial temperature adaptive responses (iii) following 2 years of soil warming by +3°C to +8°C}. We used two independent methods, bioenv and envfit (vegan package), to determine significant multivariate correlations between meta-data and Bray-curtis dissimilarity matrices for community data. Tests were performed for separate meta-data subsets to address specific hypotheses on how microbial community correlated with (\\textbf{a}) drivers from the edaphic environment, (\\textbf{b}) functional responses/soil process rates, (\\textbf{c}) temperature adaptive physiological change in the community. Significant parameters are: for (\\textbf{a}) average soil surface temperature (AST), soil gravimetric moisture (H$_{2}$O), dissolved organic carbon (DOC); for (\\textbf{b}) microbial P (micP), $\\alpha$-glucosidase V$_{\\mathrm{max}}$ (AG$_{\\mathrm{ase}}$). $\\beta$-glucosidase V$_{\\mathrm{max}}$ (BG$_{\\mathrm{ase}}$), sulfatase V$_{\\mathrm{max}}$ (S$_{\\mathrm{ase}}$), $\\beta$-xylanase V$_{\\mathrm{max}}$ (XY$_{\\mathrm{ase}}$), leucine aminopeptidase V$_{\\mathrm{max}}$ (LP V$_{\\mathrm{max}}$), \\textsl{N}-acetyl $\\beta$-glucosaminidase V$_{\\mathrm{max}}$ (N$_{\\mathrm{ase}}$), phenol oxidase V$_{\\mathrm{max}}$ (PX$_{\\mathrm{ase}}$), average soil CO$_{2}$ efflux (CO$_{2}$), enzymatic N:P ratio (enzNP); and for (\\textbf{c}) carbon-use efficiency (CUE$_{\\mathrm{cp}}$), the minimum temperature for microbial growth (T$_{\\mathrm{min}}$) and the temperature sensitivity index of microbial growth (SI); the \\textsl{Q}$_{10}$ of V$_{\\mathrm{max}}$ for respective enzymes, denoted by subscript \\textsl{Q}$_{10}$.
